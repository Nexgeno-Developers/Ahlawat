In simpler words, the State legislatures have been endowed with the power to legislate on matters relating to gaming. From a practical point of view, this can get very overwhelming and exhaustive for clients to go through each state legislation and licensing requirements (if applicable). Our Team at Ahlawat and Associates is well versed with the state-specific legislations and the relevant licensing requirements.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Ahlawat &amp; Associates, we possess thorough knowledge on the prevailing laws in India pertaining to online gaming and online sports and can assist in overcoming all regulatory issues that may arise with the gaming laws of different states.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While setting up a business in India in this industry, it should be kept in mind that online gaming platforms are classified into two heads viz. \u2018games of skill\u2019 and \u2018games of chance\u2019. \u2018Games of Skill\u2019 are those where the outcome is determined primarily by mental or physical skill, rather than chance. In simpler terms, a game of skill is when a player needs to invest their time in learning, practicing and mastering their skill in order to win. The success of any player in such games is dependent on the players awareness of the rules and practices of the same, and on how efficient the player is at such a game.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, a \u2018game of chance\u2019 is where the aspect of luck or chance dominates skill or affects the outcome of the game. A game of chance may be determined entirely or on part by mere luck (not through any particular skill of the player) such as in a throw of dice. Incidentally, in a game of chance there is no way of predicting a clear outcome.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act 1867 titled \u2018Acts not to apply to certain games\u2019 states \u2018<\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Act contained shall be held to apply to any game of mere skill wherever played\u2019. <\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This provision provides for an exclusion of games of skill from being prohibited and penalized.
